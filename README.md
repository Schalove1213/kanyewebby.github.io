<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>Kanye Omari West was born June 8, 1977 in Antlanta, Georgia. <br> <br>When Kanye was three years old his parents divorced and Kanye moved to Chicago, Illinois with his mother. His father, Ray West, is a former "Black Panther" and later became a Christian counselor. Kanye's mother, Dr. Donda West, was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University. Kanye was raised in a middle class enviroment, attending Polaris School for Individual Education in the suburbs of Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago. At the age of 10 Kanye and his mother moved to Nanjing University as part of an exchange program. According to his mother, he was the only foreigner in class, but settled in well and quickly picked up Mandarin.(Simplified Chinese)
West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age, he began writing poetry when he was five years old. West started rapping in the third grade and began making compositions at seventh grade eventually selling them to artists.</p>

  <p> West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age, he began writing poetry when he was five years old. West started rapping in the third grade and began making compositions at seventh grade eventually selling them to artists. At age thrirteen, West wrote a rap song called "Green Eggs and Ham" which is the title of a best selling children's book by Dr. Seuss.) Kanye persuaded his mother to pay for time in a recording studio. Accompanying him to the studio and despite that it was "A litte basement studio." where a microphone was hung from the ceiling by a wire clothes hanger, West's mother nonetheless supported and encouraged him. Kanye met a DJ/producer named No I.D, which made No I.D Kanyes mentor in middle school, where Kanye got to learn how to sample and program beats in a sampler he received when he was 15. West graduated from highschool and received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking paiting classes; shortly after, he transferred to Chicago State University, in which he realized that he had less time to make music and dropped out. This displeased his mother, who was also a professor at the University. She later commented, "It was drummed into my head that college is the ticket to a good life... but some career goals don't require college. For Kanye to make an album called College Dropout it was more about having the guts to embrace who you are, rather than following your path society has carved out for you."</p>

<h2> Early work and Roc-A-Fella </h2>
<p>Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990's, creating beats primarly for burgeoning local artists, eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic Soul records. His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on <i>Down to Track</I>, the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav. For a time, West produced tracks for local and a few big name rappers like Nas, Cam'ron, Ludacris, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson, and Jay-Z for his 7th record <i>The Blueprint</i>, ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella records. Despite his success as a producer, West's true aspiration was to be a rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to snatch a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the "Gangsta image" prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records. West was ultimately denied an artist deal.
  <img style="float:center;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9a/9e/43/9a9e43b491fcaf5eaff19f9b5e9b19b3--polo-ralph-kanye-west.jpg"border="5" style=border>
  <br>
  <p>West approached Capital records A&R for a record deal, he almost signed with him, but another person in the company convinced him not to. Desperate to keep West from defecting to another label, then-label head Damon Dash reluctantly singed West to Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z later admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that many saw him as producer first and formost and that his background contrasted with that of his labelmates. West's breakthrough came a year later on october 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording student after working late, he fell asleep at the wheel causing a head-on crash with another car. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in the reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West, two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition,  <b>Through the Wire</B>, expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album as according to West "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through" West added that "the album was my medicine", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. <b> Through the Wire </b> was first available on West's <B>Get Well Soon...</b> mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announed that he was working on an album called <B>The College Dropout</b>, whose overall theme was to "make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, "this is what you have to do"</p>
    <hr>
<h2> The College Dropout and Late Registration </h2>
<p> <b>The College Dropout</b> was eventually issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004 after being postponed five times due to Kanye's perfectionism. The record was a hit with tracks like <b> Through the Wire</b> shooting to number two on <i>Billboard 200</i> and <b>Slow Jamz</b> with Twista and Jamie Foxx. The album also had Kanye raise his concerns about faith and Christianity with the track <b> Jesus Walks</b>, despite industry executives' predictions that songs containing blatant declarations of faith would fail, it brought Kanye to larger audiences. <B> The College Dropout</b> would eventually hit triple platinum and garnered West with 10 grammy nominations, including AOTY (Album of the year) and Best Rap Album.</p>

  <br>
   <p> Beginning his second effort that fall, Kanye would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album. West was significantly inspired by <I>Roseland NYC lives</i>, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group <b>Portishead</b> that heavily uses orchestral strings, that Kanye wanted in his debut album but couldn't because it was too expensive. Kanye now is able to afford string arrangements for his songs and collaborates with American film score composer Jon Brion to exective produce over 7 tracks in the album, Brion had no prior knowledge of hip hop production, but Kanye didn't see this as a problem and executed his vision. The album sold 2.3 units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.

<h2> Graduation, 808s and Heartbreak, and the VMAs </h2>
<p>Fresh off spending the previous year touring with U2 and their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to composed anthemic rap songs that could operate in large arenas. To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980's.</p>
<br>
<img style="float:center;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b1/e3/9b/b1e39b57ffbd2c45eadc12a62f913842.jpg"border="5" style=border>
<p> West's third studio album, Graduation, garnered major publicity when its released date pitted West in a sales competition with rapper <b>50 Cent</b>. Upon their 2007 releases, <b>Graduation</b> outsold 50 Cent by a landslide, debuting at number one on the U.S Billboards 200 chart and selling 900k copies in the first week. West sites one of the albums tracks <b>Stronger</b> to French house duo Daft Punk, who has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica element into their music. Kanye paved way to new rappers who didn't follow the hardcore gangster mold.
<br>

<p> West was at the top, having the time of his life, till tragedy struck. Donda West, died of complications from comestic surgery in 2007. Months later West and his fiancee Alexis Phifer ended their engagement and their long-term relationship, which begun in 2002. The series of events heavily affected ye, who had a set in the Glow in the Dark Tour shortly thereafter. ye's emotions could not be conveyed through rapping, West decided to sing using the voice audio processor Auto-tune, which would be a central part to the making of his next effort, recorded mostly in Hawaii in three weeks, West announced his fourth album, <b>808's and Heartbreak</b>, where he performed his lead single, <b> Love Lockdown</b>.

<p>808's and Heartbreak, which heavily uses the Roland TR-808 drum machine and contains themes of love, loneliness, and heartache, was released by Island Def Jam in November 2008. Reviews were positive, though slightly more mixed that previous records. Despite this <b>808's and Heartbreak</b> had a significant effect on hip-hop music, encouraging other rappers to take more creative risks with thier productions. The following year Kanye was invited to the <b>2009 MTV Video Music Awards</b>, to where he led to widespread outrage and controversy when West crashed the stage and grabbed the microphone from <b>Taylor Swift</b> during her acceptance speech for <b>"Best female VIdeo"</b> proclaiming that <b>Beyonce's</b> video for "Single Ladies" was "one of the best videos of all time". He was withdrawn from the remainder of the show for his actions. Ye received Billboards <b> Top Male Artist of 2009</b> and goes quiet...</p>

<br>
<p> <b>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</b>, West's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom considered it his best work it solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, <I>Dark Fantasy</i> adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit <b>All of the Lights</b>, and Billboard hits <B>POWER</b>, <b>Monster</b>, and <b>Runaway</b>, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name directed by and starring Kanye.

This promotion ran from August 20 to December 17, 2010. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a "snub" by several media outlets. West released the collaborative album <b>Watch the Throne</b> with Jay-Z, a track from the album <b> N____ in Paris</b> became the record's highest-charting single. Kanye also went on to numerous music festivals.

<h2>Yeezus, Adidas, and SHMG(So Help Me God)</h2>
<p>Sessions for West's sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft's living room at a Paris hotel. Deteremined to "undermine the commercial", he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music.
